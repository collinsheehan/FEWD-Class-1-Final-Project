For my CodeLouisville FEWD Course 1 Project, I decided to build a website inspired by my sister's company, The Blooming Stones. She has only been using social media as an online presence and I wanted to give make a page that shows her work, services, and a way for customers to contact her. The Blooming Stones is a flower wall rental and floral design company providing services for various events such as wedding, receptions, graduations, etc. I will continue refining the project after the course is over to make it a fully functioning site. 

The requirements I chose to implement into the website are as follows:
    CSS: Hamburger links menu that shows and hides based on the size of the screen. On mobile and tablet, the hamburger is     shown, but links are shown on a desktop. Links are displayed or hidden when hamburger menu is clicked.

    CSS: The services section contains four pictures of services The Blooming Stones offers and is displayed as a flex column when in mobile view. When expanded to a tablet view, the section is displayed as a flex row with overflow wrapping to a second row and the carousel disappears and is replaced with a featured image that when hovered over, shows a caption describing the image. In the desktop view, the section is displayed as a flex row.

    Javascript: Under the logo and hamburger menu, a single picture is displayed of a flower wall, upon click of the "<" or ">" button, the carousel will loops through a series of 5 pictures displaying a different picture on every click. I believe this satisfies the loop requirement.

    Javascript: At the bottom of the page is a contact form. The form requires that a email be entered when the form is submitted or a alert with be displayed asking for an email address. If the condition is satisfied, the page alerts "Thank you."
